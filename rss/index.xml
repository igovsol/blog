<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post I will explain some important issues you must consider before becoming a Neo4j partner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully, this information will help you make an informed decision, and minimize the risk to your company and your clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to view the entire agreement this post discusses , you can find it in the link below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Full agreement:  <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/neo4j-partnership-agreement-highlighted.pdf" target="_blank">Neo4j Solution Partner Agreement</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_overview">Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Becoming a solution 'partner' involves signing a partner agreement and paying a yearly fee.
You will understand why I quoted 'partner' soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agreement has terms which effectively prevent you from working with Neo4j open source licenses while you are a partner and for 3 years after your partnership ends!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand what you are agreeing to, especially as Neo4j forks such as <a href="https://graphfoundation.org/ongdb/" target="_blank">Open Native Graph Database (ONgDB)</a> are gaining traction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in the US government, you may be at a severe disadvantage in terms of competitive bid pricing for projects involving Neo4j open source licenses and forks because of these limitations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only are the open source forks such as ONgDB already proving themselves in production in the federal government,
there are well known and trusted contractors with a great deal of past performance supporting these open source distributions.  They are not subject to the terms discussed, and can therefore do not have to consider Neo4j expensive commercial licenses in their project bids.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_terms_to_watch_out_for">Terms to watch out for</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1) The terms below prevent you from using Neo4j open source distributions during your partnership and 3 years after your stop being a partner.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During your partnership and for 3 years after your partnership ends you can&#8217;t:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use Neo4j open source distributions (including popular forks such as ONgDB).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&#8217;t offer services such as consulting, training, technical support for clients for these open source licensed distributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The investment you will make into the Neo4j ecosystem, and all the experience, past performance, knowledge you gain will be lost
if these terms kick in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind that Neo4j Inc can terminate your partnership for any reason, approach your clients, and more as you will see further in the agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>4.3.1 During the term of this Agreement, <strong>Partner may not use or run on any of Partner’s hardware,
or have deployed for internal use, any Neo Technology Community Edition Products
for commercial or production use.</strong>
In no event shall Partner reverse engineer, distribute or otherwise use the Products for its own internal use.
There are no implied rights. Partner will not fork or bifurcate the source code for any Neo Technology Community Edition Products into a separately
maintained source code repository so that development done on the original code requires manual work to be transferred to the forked
software or so that the forked software starts to have features not present in the original software.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><strong>4.3.2 During the term of this Agreement and up until thirty six (36) months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement,
Partner may not develop, market, distribute or offer any services related to any Neo Technology Community Edition Products,
derivative works of such products, or any Partner software code made to work with Neo Technology Community Edition Products
(including, without limitation, hosting services, training, technical support, configuration and customization services, etc.).</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are "Neo Technology Community Edition Products" you ask?
They are any Neo4j products used with the free open source licenses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If they had been clear and just said "open source licensed products", would you agree to these terms?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2) The partner agreement can be canceled for any reason by Neo4j Inc</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, you read this right.  Neo4j Inc can terminate the partnership for any reason, even if you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a partner agreement is terminated, the restrictions kick in:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can&#8217;t use or offer services / consulting /support for Neo4j open source distributions (and forks) for 3 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&#8217;t talk to your clients about Neo4j anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neo4j Inc can go around you and approach your clients directly for licensing and contracting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>7.2 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by a party for cause immediately if (a) the other ceases to do business, or otherwise terminates its business operations; or (b) the other materially breaches any material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice describing the breach.
<strong>In addition, Neo Technology may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing Partner with ninety (90) days prior written notice.</strong> This Agreement may be terminated as set forth on Exhibit C!.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>7.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement by either party (a) all rights and licenses of Partner hereunder will terminate and
<strong>Partner shall cease all communications with End Users regarding the Products;</strong> and (b) each party will immediately return to the other party all Confidential Information in its possession, custody or control in whichever form held (including all
copies or embodiments of the Confidential Information) and will cease using any trademarks, service marks and other designations of the other party; and (c) Partner shall pay to Neo Technology all outstanding fees. To remove all doubt, except as set forth in this Agreement,
it is hereby clarified that Partner will not be entitled to any additional remuneration, or reimbursement of any expenses
based on the expiration or termination of this Agreement. An addendum to this Agreement may specify additional effects of termination of this Agreement.
<strong>After any termination of this Agreement,  Neo Technology shall not be restricted in any manner from licensing or contracting with End Users.</strong></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3) You are not really a partner once you sign this agreement!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, you heard that correctly!   Even though the agreement is clearly labeled "NEO4J SOLUTION PARTNER AGREEMENT",
there is a term hidden way down in section 10 that says you are not really a partner.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>10.2  Relationship of Parties. This Agreement is not intended to create a relationship such as a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency,
or employment relationship. Neither party may act in a manner which expresses
or implies a relationship <strong>other than that of independent contractor</strong>, nor bind the other party.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4) Neo4j Inc may try to enforce these terms on your other companies or partners if the 'partnership' is terminated, which can for any reason</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has actually happened once already.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though this partnership agreement executed on behalf of the company signing it, Neo4j has shown that they are willing
to attempt applying these terms outside of the company who signed the agreement.  If you or your board members have other companies
you may want to understand what they have done in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While you may prevail in court, you still have to deal with the legal headaches and costs associated with this type of behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>

has a <a href="https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2018/01/03/casual-cluster-quickstart.html" target="_blank">great blog post</a> that shows you how to quickly get started with Neo4j Enterprise causal clustering using docker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The docker-compose.yml file they use for this post uses the
official Neo4j Enterprise docker image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may be a problem for you as Neo4j&#8217;s official docker images
use the commercial license and requires you to accept a <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j-publish/blob/9a175bdb484967c609c5c369256b866a577f86b3/3.3.1/enterprise/docker-entrypoint.sh" target="_blank">license agreement</a> which includes the following statement:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I simply <a href="https://github.com/igovsol/neo4j-casual-cluster-quickstart" target="_blank">forked the quick start GitHub repository</a>  and updated the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igovsol/neo4j-casual-cluster-quickstart/master/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">docker-compose.yml</a> file to use the free open source binaries that we compile from the official Neo4j GitHub repository for US government agencies.</p>

<p>Are you looking to get your hands on actual Neo4j Enterprise commercial pricing information?  If so, this post is for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neo4j Inc keeps it&#8217;s pricing information under close guard and only releases it under the close 'guidance' of a sales person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand why this is the case, you have to understand a few things about Neo4j Enterprise.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neo4j Enterprise is available under a dual license model. You have the choice of using it with either a commercial or the open source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commercial license is included when you purchase a paid commercial annual subscription.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a commercial license, then Neo4j Enterprise simply defaults to the standard open source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use Neo4j Enterprise with it&#8217;s open source license in any environment , including production, and yes you CAN use it in closed source projects!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no core or instance limitations when you use Neo4j Enterprise with it&#8217;s open source license.  Commercial subscriptions place limits on cores and instances, just look at the pricing to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My next post will address a lot of Neo4j AGPL mis-information that has been circulating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The US Federal government is already using Neo4j Enterprise in production, closed source projects with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commercial license is actually more restrictive in most scenarios, so what are you really paying for when you purchase a Neo4j Enterprise commercial subscription?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are basically paying for production email and phone support for Neo4j.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very important to understand that Neo4j production support only covers Neo4j. It does not cover any of the other software you use in your project such as ElasticSearch, Kafka, Postgresql, client side UI apps, micro-services, or custom applications.  I.E. It only covers a single component of your technology stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need production support for your project, it makes no sense to only purchase production support for Neo4j while leaving all the other software unsupported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would be like only buying support for the alternator of a new custom car you had built.  If its transmission fails - good luck!  You want support to cover the entire car.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, before jumping into the prices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to point out that in most scenarios, purchasing a Neo4j Enterprise commercial subscription makes no sense if you are in development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why would you need production support for something that has not yet been built.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your budget on production support for something not yet even built or in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use your budget to develop your solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, we would be happy to help you build and support your graph solution.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So where does this pricing information come from?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A while back, Neo4j Inc allowed one of it&#8217;s partners, a company I highly respect,
to add Neo4j commercial subscriptions
to their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7w76NCg0bmVd2dpcU5lTjBsQWs/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">GSA schedule 70 contract</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This made the pricing information public , which is why I can post it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pricing information below has been copied directly from the GSA Schedule contract mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I just formatted it to make it easier to read.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="_neo4j_enterprise_commercial_pricing" class="discrete">Neo4j Enterprise Commercial Pricing</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GSA Schedule 70 pricing for SIN 132-32 is discounted for the first year at a percentage off of the commercial list price. All future price increases shall adhere to the EPA clause GSAR 552.216-70 Economic Price Adjustment for compliance with the GSA terms and conditions of this Schedule 70 Contract Award.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neo4j Bundles are available by Annual Subscription.  All prices are Annual Subscription prices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Neo4j database runtime is called an “Instance”. Clusters comprise multiple instances: normally three or more. Instances normally run on different machines / OSs, although multiple instances can be run on a single machine / OS. Each Neo4j instance runs inside of a corresponding Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Neo4j instances running in virtualized environments, only the number of cores allotted to the virtual OS in which Neo4j is running need be licensed. For virtual machines running in EC2 and other virtualized Cloud platforms (such as SoftLayer, Oracle Cloud, et al.), “virtual cores” and “virtual CPUs” (vCPUs) each count as one core.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Neo4j Bundles include a commercial license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition. The commercial license grants rights to the use of Neo4j Enterprise in commercial and/or federal and government projects on an annual / renewable basis, and includes Support in the GSA purchase price.</p>

<p>Neo4j Enterprise is still open source under it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>. However you may have noticed that you can no longer build the enterprise package binary from the source code or download the enterprise package binary with it&#8217;s free <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a> from dist.neo4j.org.  Furthermore, if you use docker, <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j-publish/commit/aa31654ee8544cd544b369d2646cf372086f7b70" target="_blank">you must now accept a 'commercial agreement’ before proceeding</a>.  In other words, official Neo4j docker images are no longer packaged with the free <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3</a> licensed binaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neo4j Enterprise 'binaries’ are simply the compiled and packaged Neo4j distributions you download and run on your computer, server, container, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the 3.3.0 release the enterprise binary package file names would be <a href="https://dist.igovsol.com/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz" target="_blank">neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz</a>
for the linux package and <a href="https://dist.igovsol.com/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-windows.zip" target="_blank">neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-windows.zip</a> for the windows package.
(The links above point to the binaries iGov Inc compiled and packaged using the source code found at the Neo4j Github repository.
  By default it is packaged with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why has Neo4j Inc made it harder to access the open source enterprise binaries?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If they are going to take the trouble to make Neo4j Enterprise more inaccessible to the public, why not just take Neo4j closed source before releasing 3.3.0?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only Neo4j Inc can answer these questions, and I feel they owe an explanation to the open source community which has made Neo4j what it is today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With ambitions of an IPO, it would be an extremely risky maneuver to attempt taking Neo4j closed source.  It could backfire and be disastrous if the community revolted and creates a more successful Neo4j fork. Even the perceived threat of this sort of behavior could trigger a revolt and fork.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a reference, look no further than MySQL and <a href="https://mariadb.org/about/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a> , the more popular fork of MySQL, and  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-mariadb-a-mysql-fork-challenges-oracle/" target="_blank">you can see what could happen</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It looks like Neo4j Inc does not want to tempt fate with a closed source move just yet.   Instead another path was taken which makes it very hard to get ahold of the enterprise packaged binaries with the free <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>. As a passionate advocate of both open source software and Neo4j, this does not sit well with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Federal agencies have already invested in the adoption and use of Neo4j Enterprise and many are using it&#8217;s free <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.  Luckily,  iGov Inc builds the Neo4j binaries from the source code and makes it available via a <a href="https://igovsol.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">distribution site we setup</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Back to the core of this post.   So what has Neo4j Inc done to limit your access to Neo4j Enterprise binaries packaged with the free open source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Action 1</strong>:  The enterprise packaging build instructions <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/commit/affe1a0b4ab47c9d4673bfa507868ccd03c48ddd" target="_blank">were removed from the code base</a>.   Until the 3.3.0 release,  anyone could have checked out the <a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j" target="_blank">Neo4j source code from github</a>, and run a few simple commands to build the Neo4j Enterprise binaries complete with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.   That’s not the case anymore.  If you run the build commands on the 3.3.0 branch you will notice that only the Neo4j Community Edition binary is present after the build process completes.  Who really uses Neo4j Community Edition once they realized Neo4j Enterprise edition is also free?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The packaging system simply provides the instructions on how to ‘build’ the Neo4j Enterprise distribution binary, much like the instructions you get with furniture purchased at IKEA.    All the artifacts that are used to build the Neo4j Enterprise binary are all open source, but the instructions explaining how to put together these artifacts have disappeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://blog.igovsol.com/images/standalone-1.png" alt="standalone 1.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Action 2</strong>:  Neo4j Inc slipped a commercial license into the official binaries found on their distribution site that is used for docker images.  Until now, if you wanted to download the Neo4j Enterprise binary from Neo4j Inc directly, you could have done so using the distribution site which is publically available. It just isn&#8217;t advertised for obvious reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those who were using the official docker images or downloading the enterprise binary directly from dist.neo4j.org were in for a surprise when they were forced to accept commercial terms in order to access the distributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Want to see for yourself - download the <a href="http://dist.neo4j.org/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz" target="_blank">Neo4j Enterprise binary</a> which Neo4j Inc packages and take a look at the LICENSE.txt file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of the standard <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a> which used to be there, the LICENSE.txt file now says:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Network Engine for Objects in Lund AB. 2017.
All Rights Reserved. Use of this Software without
a proper commercial license with Neo4j, Inc. or its affiliates
is prohibited.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As copyright holders, Neo4j Inc has the right to add any license they want for the binary distributions they build, package, and make available for download themselves.  If anyone else packages the enterprise binary distribution like we do, you must simply make sure the LICENSE.txt file is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>.  That is exactly what we do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Action 3</strong>: Neo4j Inc kept causal cluster communication encryption (Intra-cluster encryption) off by default. They then created a ‘proprietary module’ that turns it on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course you can get intra-cluster encryption turned back on by purchasing a costly commercial package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This move was referenced in the <a href="https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-3-0/" target="_blank">3.3.0 release changelog</a>.  They justified this change with the following blurb:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Neo4j Enterprise Edition binaries now include new proprietary
add-ons. Intra-cluster encryption is the first of these.
Consequently Neo4j Enterprise Edition can no longer be
distributed under a dual license but the source is still
available under AGPLv3.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course Neo4j Enterprise can still be distributed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>. Simply provide a binary download without the 'proprietary add-ons' that turn on intra-cluster encryption.  The Neo4j Enterprise binaries we make available to the public are proof that this can be done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe that security critical components of Neo4j should remain open source, security by obscurity has proven not to be a good strategy in the past.  Currently, the security components of Neo4j Enterprise are still open source. In the case of intra-cluster encryption (causal clustering) - it is just not initialized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now the only difference between the paid Neo4j Enterprise (commercial) binary and Neo4j Enterprise (open source) binary (we compile from source) is that intra-cluster encryption is still off by default in the AGPLv3 version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We turn it back on for our federal customers via a new component in our FISMA framework, which will be available on github for everyone to use soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How many of you are actually using causal clustering in production?  Well - if you upgrade to 3.3.0 and don&#8217;t turn it back on yourself , you may be a little less secure assuming you aren&#8217;t using encrypted tunnels / vpn, etc between your cluster nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look for yourself:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/3.2/enterprise/causal-clustering/src/main/java/org/neo4j/causalclustering/discovery/HazelcastClientConnector.java" target="_blank">3.2 release code</a> : The sslPolicy initialized in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">HazelcastClientConnector( Config config, LogProvider logProvider, SslPolicy sslPolicy,
            HostnameResolver hostnameResolver )
    {
        this.config = config;
        this.logProvider = logProvider;
        this.sslPolicy = sslPolicy;
        this.hostnameResolver = hostnameResolver;
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/3.3/enterprise/causal-clustering/src/main/java/org/neo4j/causalclustering/discovery/HazelcastClientConnector.java" target="_blank">3.3 release code</a>  :  The sslPolicy initialization has disappeared.</p>

            this.logProvider = logProvider;
            this.hostnameResolver = hostnameResolver;
        }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These three actions effectively made it impossible to get Neo4j Enterprise binaries with the open source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3 license</a>  from Neo4j Inc starting with the 3.3.0 release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consulting company offering software development and support for Neo4j Enterprise open source licenses to the US federal government, we have been building the binaries ourselves for some time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the Neo4j open source community, we’ve decided to absorb the hosting costs and make these distributions available to the general public, not just US federal agencies.  We’ve setup a distribution site that can be used to download Neo4j Enterprise directly, or use use with docker compose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will have docker images up as well complete with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3</a> licensed packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will also have the FISMA framework modules on GitHub soon, one of which turns back on intra-cluster encryption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can download the  Neo4j Enterprise binaries with the open source license from our website at <a href="https://igovsol.com/downloads.html" class="bare">https://igovsol.com/downloads.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We compile and package these using the source code from the official Neo4j GitHub repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Federal agencies should email us at <a href="mailto:support@igovsol.com">support@igovsol.com</a> to get their AWS GovCloud download links which should be whitelisted for most agencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would were not aware that Neo4j Enterprise is open source just like it&#8217;s sibling 'Neo4j Community Edition', you can <a href="https://igovsol.com/downloads.html#neo4j-os-faqs" target="_blank">learn more here</a>.</p>
