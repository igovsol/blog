Neo4j Inc keeps it's pricing information under close guard and is only released under the 'guidance' of a sales person.

To understand why this is the case, you have to understand a few things about Neo4j Enterprise.

---

Neo4j Enterprise is available under a dual license model. You have the choice of using it with either a commercial or the open source https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"]

The commercial license is included with paid commercial subscriptions.

If you don't have a commercial license, then Neo4j Enterprise simply defaults to the standard open source https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"]. 


You can use Neo4j Enterprise with it's open source license in any environment , including production, and yes you CAN use it in closed source projects!  There are no core or instance limitations if you use it under the open source license. 

My next post will address the Neo4j AGPL mis-information that is floating around on this subject. 

The US Federal government is already using Neo4j Enterprise in production, with the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"] in closed source projects.  

The commercial license is actually more restrictive in most scenarios, so what are you really paying for when you purchase a Neo4j Enterprise commercial subscription? 

You are basically paying for production email and phone support for Neo4j.    

It is very important to understand that Neo4j production support only covers Neo4j. It does not cover any of the other software you use in your project such as ElasticSearch, Kafka, client side UI, micro-services, or custom applications. I.E. It only covers a single component of your technology stack.

If you need production support for your project, it makes no sense to purchase production support for Neo4j while leaving all the other software unsupported.

Buying support for Neo4j would be like only getting support for the water pump of a new custom car you had built.  If its transmission fails - good luck!




---


Finally, before jumping into the prices. 

I want to point out that in most scenarios, purchasing a Neo4j Enterprise commercial subscription makes no sense if you have not yet developed your solution. I.E. If you are in development.    Why would you need production support for something that has not yet been built.   

Don't waste your budget on unnecessary production support for something not yet in production. Use your budget to develop your graph solution.

So where does this pricing information come from?

A while back, Neo4j Inc allowed one of it's partners, and a great company I know well and respect,
to add Neo4j commercial subscriptions
on their https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7w76NCg0bmVd2dpcU5lTjBsQWs/view?usp=sharing[ GSA schedule 70 contract, window="_blank" ].

This instantly made the pricing information 'public domain'. 

The pricing information below has been copied directly from the GSA Schedule contract mentioned above.  I just formatted it to make it easier to read.

== Neo4j Enterprise Commercial Pricing





GSA Schedule 70 pricing for SIN 132-32 is discounted for the first year at a percentage off of the commercial list price. All future price increases shall adhere to the EPA clause GSAR 552.216-70 Economic Price Adjustment for compliance with the GSA terms and conditions of this Schedule 70 Contract Award.

Neo4j Bundles are available by Annual Subscription. All prices are Annual Subscription prices.

The Neo4j database runtime is called an “Instance”. Clusters comprise multiple instances: normally three or more. Instances normally run on different machines / OSs, although multiple instances can be run on a single machine / OS. Each Neo4j instance runs inside of a corresponding Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance.

For Neo4j instances running in virtualized environments, only the number of cores allotted to the virtual OS in which Neo4j is running need be licensed. For virtual machines running in EC2 and other virtualized Cloud platforms (such as SoftLayer, Oracle Cloud, et al.), “virtual cores” and “virtual CPUs” (vCPUs) each count as one core.

All Neo4j Bundles include a commercial license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition. The commercial license grants rights to the use of Neo4j Enterprise in commercial and/or federal and government projects on an annual / renewable basis, and includes Support in the GSA purchase price.
