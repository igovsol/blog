https://graphaware.com/[GraphAware, window="_blank"] 
has a https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2018/01/03/casual-cluster-quickstart.html[great blog post, window="_blank"] that shows you how to quickly get started with Neo4j Enterprise causal clustering using docker.

The docker-compose.yml file they use for this post uses the
official Neo4j Enterprise docker image.

This may be a problem for you as Neo4j's official docker images
use the commercial license and requires you to accept a https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j-publish/blob/9a175bdb484967c609c5c369256b866a577f86b3/3.3.1/enterprise/docker-entrypoint.sh[license agreement, window="_blank"] which includes the following statement:

----
Use of this Software without a proper commercial license 
with Neo4j Inc. or its affiliates is prohibited.
----
