https://graphaware.com/[GraphAware, window="_blank"] has a https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2018/01/03/casual-cluster-quickstart.html[great blog post, window="_blank"] that shows you how to quickly get started with Neo4j Enterprise causal clustering using docker.

The docker-compose.yml file they use for this post uses the
official Neo4j Enterprise docker image.
This may be a problem for you as Neo4j's official docker images
use the commercial license and requires you to accept a license agreement!
