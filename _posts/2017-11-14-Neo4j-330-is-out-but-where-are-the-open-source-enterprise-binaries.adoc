:hp-alt-title: Neo4j 3.3.0 is out, but where are the open source enterprise binaries?


Neo4j 3.3.0 has been released and it has some great improvements and updates. You can read about them in the https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-3-0/[3.3.0 release changelog , window="_blank"]   

Neo4j Enterprise is still free under its open source https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"]. However you may have noticed that you can no longer build the enterprise package binaries from the source code or download enterprise package binary with it's free https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"] from dist.neo4j.org.  Furthermore, if you use docker, https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j-publish/commit/aa31654ee8544cd544b369d2646cf372086f7b70[you must now accept a 'commercial agreement’ before proceeding, window="_blank"].  In other words, official Neo4j docker images are no longer packaged with the free https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3, window="_blank"] licensed binaries.  

Neo4j Enterprise 'binaries’ are simply the packaged Neo4j distributions you download and run on your computer, server, container, etc.   For the 3.3.0 release the enterprise binary package file names would be https://dist.igovsol.com/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz[neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz , window="_blank"] for the Linux package and https://dist.igovsol.com/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-windows.zip[neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-windows.zip , window="_blank"] for the windows package. (The links above point to the binaries we packaged with the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"].)

Why has Neo4j Inc made it harder to access the open source enterprise binaries? 

If they are going to take the trouble to make Neo4j Enterprise open source packages more inaccessible, why not just take Neo4j Enterprise closed source before releasing 3.3.0? 

Only Neo4j Inc can answer these questions, and I feel they owe an explanation to the open source community which has made Neo4j what it is today.

With ambitions of an IPO, it would be an extremely risky maneuver to take Neo4j closed source.  It could backfire and be disastrous if the community revolts and creates a successful Neo4j fork.

As a reference, look no further than MySQL , or rather what we now call https://mariadb.org/about/[MariaDB , window="_blank"] - the more popular fork of MySQL, and http://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-mariadb-a-mysql-fork-challenges-oracle/[can see what could happen , window="_blank"].

It looks like Neo4j Inc does not want to tempt fate with a closed source move just yet.   Instead another path was taken which makes it very hard to get ahold of the enterprise packaged binaries with the free https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"]. As a passionate advocate of both open source software and Neo4j - this doesn’t sit well with me.

Many federal agencies have already invested in the adoption and use of Neo4j Enterprise using it's https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license , window="_blank"] open source license and if forced to pay for costly commercial subscriptions, they may likely replace Neo4j all together with an open source alternative.  Luckily, we happen to be Neo4j developers and these moves simply do not affect us or our federal clients because we already build the binaries from the source code - which defaults to the open source license.

Back to the core of this post.   So what has Neo4j Inc done to limit your access to official Neo4j Enterprise binaries packaged with the free open source https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"]?

*Action 1*:  The enterprise packaging build instructions https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/commit/affe1a0b4ab47c9d4673bfa507868ccd03c48ddd[were removed from the code base , window="_blank"].   Until the 3.3.0 release,  anyone could have checked out the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j[Neo4j source code from github , window="_blank"], and run a few simple commands to build the free Neo4j Enterprise binaries.   That’s not the case anymore.  If you run the same commands that worked before,  you will notice only community binaries are built.  Who really uses Neo4j Community Edition once  they realize they can use Enterprise edition for free?  

The packaging system simply provides the instructions on how to ‘build’ the Neo4j Enterprise distribution binaries, much like the instructions you get with your furniture you get at IKEA.    All the artifacts that are used to build the neo4j-enterprise binary are still present and open source, but the instructions explaining how to put together these artifacts into the neo4j-enterprise binary you download have disappeared.   

*Action 2*:  Neo4j Inc slipped a commercial license into their distribution site binary downloads that are used for docker and direct downloads of Neo4j Enterprise.    Many people were not even aware that you could download Neo4j Enterprise at dist.neo4j.org, but those who were using it and those who were using the official docker images that use the distribution were in for a surprise when they were forced to accept commercial terms in order to access the distributions.  

Want to see for yourself - download the http://dist.neo4j.org/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0-unix.tar.gz[Neo4j Inc's Neo4j Enterprise binary, window="_blank"] and take a look at the LICENSE.txt file.

Instead of the standard https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"] which used to be there, the LICENSE.txt file now says:

----
Network Engine for Objects in Lund AB. 2017. All Rights Reserved.
Use of this Software without a proper commercial license with
Neo4j, Inc. or its affiliates is prohibited.
----



As copyright holders, Neo4j Inc has the right to add any license they want for the binary distributions they build and package themselves. If you package the enterprise binary distribution like we do, you simply must make sure the LICENSE.txt file is the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"] 

*Action 3*: Neo4j Inc kept hazelcast ssl (causal cluster communication encryption) off by default , then created a ‘proprietary module’ that turns it on.

This move was referenced in the https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-3-0/[3.3.0 release changelog , window="_blank"].  They justified this change with the following blurb:

----

Neo4j Enterprise Edition binaries now include new proprietary add-ons. Intra-cluster encryption is the first of these. Consequently Neo4j Enterprise Edition can no longer be distributed under a dual license but the source is still available under AGPLv3.

----



That is one way to say it.  Of course, they could have easily just provided a Neo4j Enterprise binary with the intra cluster encryption turned off under it’s https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 license, window="_blank"].  

Security critical components should be open source, security by obscurity has proven not to be a good strategy in the past.
 
Right now the only difference between the paid Neo4j Enterprise (commercial) binary and Neo4j Enterprise (open source) binary is that intra cluster encryption is turned on in the commercial version and is turned off in the open source binary.  
How many of you are actually using causal clustering in production?  Well - if you upgrade to 3.3.0 and don't turn it back on yourself , you may be a little less secure assuming you aren't using encrypted tunnels / vpn, etc between your cluster nodes.



Look for yourself:  

https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/3.2/enterprise/causal-clustering/src/main/java/org/neo4j/causalclustering/discovery/HazelcastClientConnector.java[3.2 release code , window="_blank"] : The sslPolicy initialized in the code.

[source,java]
----

HazelcastClientConnector( Config config, LogProvider logProvider, SslPolicy sslPolicy,
            HostnameResolver hostnameResolver )
    {
        this.config = config;
        this.logProvider = logProvider;
        this.sslPolicy = sslPolicy;
        this.hostnameResolver = hostnameResolver;
    }
  
----

    
https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/3.3/enterprise/causal-clustering/src/main/java/org/neo4j/causalclustering/discovery/HazelcastClientConnector.java[3.3 release code , window="_blank"]  :  The sslPolicy initialization has disapeared .
    
[source,java]
----
    HazelcastClientConnector( Config config, LogProvider logProvider, HostnameResolver hostnameResolver )
        {
            this.config = config;
            this.logProvider = logProvider;
            this.hostnameResolver = hostnameResolver;
        }
----

If you want causal clustering interserver encryption turned  back on, simply pay for a commercial package. 
    
These three actions effectively made it impossible to get Neo4j Enterprise under its free open source license from Neo4j Inc starting with the 3.3.0 release.     
   
As a consulting company offering software development and support for Neo4j Enterprise open source licenses - we had to package and provide a way for our federal clients to download the open source Enterprise distributions.   

As part of the Neo4j open source community, we’ve decided to absorb the hosting costs and make these distributions available to the general public, not just US federal agencies.  We’ve setup a distribution site that can be used to download Neo4j Enterprise directly, or use with docker.   We will have docker images up as well complete with the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html[AGPLv3 , window="_blank"] licensed packages.  

You can download Neo4j Enterprise Distributions from our website at https://igovsol.com/downloads.html.   Federal agencies should email us at neo4j@igovsol.com to get their AWS GovCloud download links which should be whitelisted for most agencies.

If you would were not aware that Neo4j Enterprise is open source just like it's sibling called 'Neo4j Community Edition', you can https://igovsol.com/downloads.html#neo4j-os-faqs[learn more here].

If you are not happy with these moves, then please reach out to Neo4j Inc and voice your concerns.  As the community that made Neo4j what it is today, you have a voice in it's future if you choose to speak up.  

Feel free to contact me directly via email at jmsuhy@igovsol.com anytime if you have questions, comments, or just want to talk about Neo4j in general. Though we only focus on US Federal government agencies, I am always happy to talk about technologies I am passionate about.
